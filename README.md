#### SpiiceNX is an open-sourced lego hack that anyone is allowed to copy, edit, and distribute.
_ _ _
## **INTRODUCTION**
### SpiiceNX is an exploit formerly owned by a person whose name is called by 'JalapenoGuy'.
### His enjoying is mostly based on designing exploits for a lego game 'Roblox'.
### Due to his lack of coding skills, he is often referred to as a script kiddie (A person who relies on pasting with no such credits). 
### By that thought and being labeled around it, this would protect him from any possible insults that can harm him and his career.
### Being called a skid would mean that the insulting person, would insult himself at a cause since the person who'd insult would refer to himself as a person who lacks understandings about the person he's insulting.
### Having a skidded close-sourced project would harm the community and giving the community no idea that the project is made up of stolen code or without any permission to view the code, suspicion would rise on the exploit/owner.

## **INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROJECT**
### I can't state that this project is filled with stolen code as some parts such as the UI or Extra features.
### If you copy, edit, impersonate me or distribute this, I will have no right to Copyright you or file a DMCA notice. However, if you impersonate me, then I'll be disappointed with you.
### When this project was first introduced, only %0.5-1 of the code wasn't owned by me. But, later on, the percentage increased, but the exploit was more efficient.
### This project isn't discontinued and hopefully will never be, I will contribute as much as I can daily on the updates of my exploit.
### Please do not expect much special of this project for this is open-sourced and you much be grateful.
